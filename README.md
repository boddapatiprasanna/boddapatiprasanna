### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**boddapatiprasanna/boddapatiprasanna** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my masters at North West Missouri State University
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Webapps, Java and Adavanced database Systems
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on webapps projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with assignments 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about cultural activities
- ğŸ“« You can reach me through phone
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always do messing things and will fall in trouble.
